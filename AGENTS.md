Block Knight (方块骑士): a browser 3D action RPG in blocky style, landscape
only, played on phones; the defence is guarding, there is no dodge.
No bundler: plain global-scope `<script>` tags loaded in manifest order by
`core/client_boot.js`; views are fetch-loaded HTML partials. Serve over http
(`file://` breaks `fetch` and `import()`): `python -m http.server 8422` or
`Run-Game.bat`.

The one exception to "no modules": three.js. `client-assets.json` lists it
under `modules`; the boot loader `import()`s it first and exposes it as the
global `THREE`. It is vendored in `vendor/three/` (0.186.1, bundled and
minified into one file with esbuild, MIT licence alongside). Only `render/`
(and the move tuner's view, `tune/view.js`) uses `THREE`. PeerJS (1.5.5,
its own `dist/peerjs.min.js`, MIT) is an ordinary script in
`vendor/peerjs/` giving the global `Peer`; only `net/` uses it.

- `core/` simulation and maths with no DOM and no three.js: coordinates,
  matrices and box tests, rig and forward kinematics, terrain (16 x 16
  chunks, editable), the fixed-step loop, fight rules and hit tests, the
  fighters, world entities (training dummy, monsters and their AI,
  buildings, portals, chests, drops, thickets, resources that grow
  back), the interact key, items,
  gear and trade, the save format (storage injected), input maths, and
  the PVP duel protocol (host
  authority, guest prediction) over an injected `send`. Node tests run it;
  in a duel the host's copy decides. Also the boot loader.
- `models/` model data: skeletons, boxes, equipment, key poses, palette.
- `render/` three.js drawing only (terrain as one mesh per chunk); reads the
  simulation, never writes it. The menu's figure and the item icons are
  drawn by a second, small renderer (`figure_view.js`).
- `ui/` DOM: input layer, app start-up, HUD, procedural sound, room screen,
  the menu (figure, gear and bag, settings), item screens (shop, smithy).
- `net/` the channel between two phones: PeerJS rooms, or `?link=local`
  (BroadcastChannel between two tabs, for tests). No game rules.
- `tune/` the move tuner, a second page (`tune.html`, desktop, entry
  `tune` in `client-assets.json`): `lab.js` edits key poses and move timing
  live, previews moves and combos through the real simulation, makes the
  hit tests' checks and writes the edits out as source text (no DOM, no
  three.js; Node tests run it); `view.js` draws with three.js; `panel.js`
  is the page. `tune.html` loads `game_config.js` unfrozen
  (`window.unfrozenConfig`); the game never loads `tune/`.
- `mapview/` the map preview, a third page (`map.html`, entry `map` in
  `client-assets.json`; read-only, no three.js): `plan.js` turns a map of
  `gameConfig.maps` into plain data through the game's own loader, names
  a cell (`field (23, 5)`), measures a walk and casts one screen of
  ground from the camera (no DOM; Node tests run it); `page.js` draws it
  on a 2D canvas with numbered columns and rows. The game never loads
  `mapview/`.
- `vendor/` third-party files, unmodified apart from bundling.
- `index.html`, `tune.html`, `map.html`, `style.css`, `partials/` stay at root (fetch paths are document-relative)

The code, `game_config.js` and the tests are the description of current
behaviour. `docs/tasks/` (Chinese) holds three documents and no more:
`design.md` (what the game is and the rules decided, marked where the user
decided them), `parameters.md` (every number in `game_config.js`, readable)
and `roadmap.md` (what was done, what is next, how to test in this
container). New decisions go into the matching section of `design.md`. The
2D version is tag `v1-2d` (commit `2a313c4`).
This file only changes when project setup changes.

## Rules

- Tunable numbers live only in `game_config.js`. When they change, update
  `docs/tasks/parameters.md` to match. Model shapes and key
  poses are data in `models/`, not tunables.
- What is drawn is what is judged: poses that change a body's volume are a
  pure function of simulation state (`core/player_anim.js`); `render/` adds
  only drawn-only motion (breathing, leaning).
- Done = `node --test "tests/*.test.cjs"` passes. If a change alters what a test
  asserts, update the test and say why. `tests/browser-smoke.test.cjs` runs
  when Playwright is installed and skips otherwise; on Windows, install
  `playwright-core` anywhere and set `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` to it and
  `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome`.
- New script or partial: register it in `client-assets.json` under its
  page's entry; a partial also needs `#mount-<id>` in that page
  (`index.html`, `tune.html` or `map.html`).
- Code comments and `AGENTS.md` in English; `README.md`, UI text and
  `docs/tasks/` in Chinese.
- Ask the user before adding a feature they did not ask for, or changing
  a rule already decided (user, 2026-10-05). Keep `design.md` short: what
  the game is and the rules decided, not how they are built or tested;
  its section numbers stay, code comments cite them.
